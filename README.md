The PhotoLabs project for the Web Development React course programming.

# Photolabs
**PhotoLabs** is a React-based single-page application (SPA) client-side web application that allows users to explore and interact with a vast collection of photos from various categories, or "topics." Users can view photos, click on them to see larger versions, like their favorite photos, and easily navigate between different photo categories.

## Project Structure:

The project is structured to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience for exploring and interacting with photos.
It includes components such as the homepage, topic navigation, photo detail view, and a notification badge for liked photos.

## Technologies Used:

* Client-Side Application (React SPA):

     - PhotoLabs is developed as a single-page application (SPA) using the React framework. It provides an interactive and dynamic user interface for browsing and interacting with photos.
* Client-Server Communication:

    - PhotoLabs facilitates seamless communication between the client-side application and the API server using HTTP requests and responses in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. This communication enables real-time data retrieval and user interactions, ensuring a responsive user experience.

* Custom hooks and state management to handle user interactions
